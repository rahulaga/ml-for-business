45,Mixed feelings,"I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice, soft and flows well. the fit is good, i ordered 30, could have gone with 29, not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there, too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit, which is a disappointment when you pay so muc",1,General,Bottoms,Jeans
37,,"Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5"" and about 170# with 30"" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors...........",1,General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge
44,,"This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it.",1,General,Tops,Blouses
24,This is a trial and error dress,This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love,1,General,Dresses,Dresses
70,Pretty but sizing and cut is way off,"Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.",0,General,Dresses,Dresses
59,,Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.,1,General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans
44,Pretty blouse,"I bought this blouse with the 30% off price- i don't think i would pay full price for it, but for the sale price i think it's fair.  as the other reviewers have said, it's definitely navy in front, not black, but it's a nice color combination and can be worn with dark jeans, or with black pants for a more casual work look.  it's sheer, but a dark cami underneath fixes the problem.  i think it fits true to size, with the understanding that it's supposed to be flow-y and loose.",1,General,Tops,Knits
37,Great for leggings,"I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5"", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months.",1,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
38,My new favorite dress!!,"This dress rules.  so comfy, and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats, wedges, booties, boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either, i am a 34c.",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
62,Huge disappointment,"These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.",0,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
56,,Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
39,Comfortable and flattering,"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is",1,General Petite,Intimate,Lounge
28,Love love love this skirt!,"I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it!

i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!",1,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
66,Keeper,"Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it's hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down, which is hard to find too. perfect length, beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos don't show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look",1,General,Tops,Sweaters
39,Trend of he seson,"I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6"" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me 2 inches below my knee. i love it.",1,General,Jackets,Jackets

32,Well-made but lacks structure,I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.,1,Initmates,Intimate,Swim

46,"Strange cut, pretty idea","I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.

the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color, i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can.",0,General,Tops,Blouses

32,So soft and flowy,"This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4"" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it's so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red.",1,General,Tops,Knits
65,Fabulous tank,I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,1,Initmates,Intimate,Intimates
32,,"This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top, but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously, i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.",0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
31,Oddly short-waisted,"I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.",0,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
44,Very comfortable!!,"I love this skirt! so soft and comfortable, i wore it casual with black nike sneakers, a black loose turtleneck top and a moto leather jacket. i tried on the m and l and went with the m, so i would say it is true to size because that is what i usually wear. i'm 5'9', 145 lbs,
nice thick fabric, but not heavy, good for cool weather.",1,General,Bottoms,Skirts
54,Easy breezy pants,"These pants are a must for any girl's summer warm weather wardrobe! i tried them on in the store and loved them. but... i am just over 5' and they were too long in the xs, even with 2.5 inch heels. so i ordered them in an xs petite and they are perfect with my 2.5-3 inch heels. 
i love that they are wide-legged! they look cool and are flattering! i am a teacher and plan on wearing them to work during the warmer months with a nice solid tee and a statement necklace. and of course, heels. i highl",1,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
49,Not what i was expecting...,"I was expecting a tee shirt, but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.",0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
54,"Overall great dress, runs small","This dress is beautiful with gorgeous coloring, nice thick, stretchy fabric and wonderful detailing including buttons. the only issue i had with it is that it's does run small, especially in the bust. i'm normally a medium to large, depending on cut so after reading the previous reviews, i ordered a large and it's pretty snug. still deciding whether i will keep or try for an xl, which is doubtful in availability at this point. i ordered it with two other pieces, both of those a medium fit fine.",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
49,Beautiful dress,The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.,1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
54,Boxy,"I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back.",0,General,Tops,Fine gauge
25,Amazing maxi,Bought this dress in store after trying it on. loved it. it's sexy with the lower cut front. the fabric is flowy and breathable. runs true to size. usually wear a 10 with my hips but the 8 fit better on top.the sides are well designed so your bra doesn't show. i'm 5''6' 32g size 29/30 jeans and athletic/hourglass built. i can't wait to wear it out. the pictures don't do it justice.,1,General,Dresses,Dresses

39,"Pretty, flirty and loose","I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red, but was sold out and don't have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit, flirty, flattering, very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned, the fabric is a bit heavy for summer, but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment, no biggie, i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering, chest area not too snug, and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs, 26.5 in",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

36,Super comfy. great fall colors.,"This skirt could not be more comfortable. and the colors are great--nice and vibrant. i got compliments on it the first day i wore it. the only problem is it fits larger than i thought it would--it's really stretchy fabric too. i'm a little curvy on the bottom and am short waisted, so i opted for a medium. i should have ordered the small. but it still works.

the other thing that's nice is that for short people like me (i""m between 5'2"" and 5'3"") it doesn't drag on the ground; in fact it fits me",1,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts

it runs quite large, in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i don't think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip",0,General,Dresses,Dresses

the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly, i tried the medium as well, and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference,",1,General Petite,Tops,Knits

the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy, the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.",0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses

34,A pop of color and style,"Pros:
- fits tts. i tried on a size m and it fit well for my 36c and hourglass frame.
- the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class.
- love the pop of yellow. not too showy and yet cute and fun.

- will go with many outfits.
-wore a nude bra and had no see-through issues.

cons:
- does seem a tad delicate, easy to snag due to being a knit, but otherwise solid construction.
- unlined.

24,A very blouse-like dress - very cute,"This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress, but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small), and i am larger on top, so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front, but it was just the back.",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

62,Beautiful spring dress!,"Tried this is my normal 4, and it fits exactly as shown. i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay, especially in the bust and hips. i found the quality to be very nice, length was slightly above the knee on my 5'7"" frame so it feels work-appropriate. my only wish is that the colors/pattern could transition better to multiple seasons. it definitely feels very springy and not much else.",1,General,Dresses,Dresses

66,Exquisite print makes the dress even more fabulous,"First, let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground, the tones of rose, pink, purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large, as i am 5' 3"" and usually an size 6, but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped, it is a tad big, but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress, as it does not flare out in any way, but is certainly is loose and flowing, bu",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

53,Loved this shirt - but only in navy,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,1,General,Tops,Blouses

i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size.",1,General,Tops,Sweaters

63,Super comfy,I've read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but i'm so happy i did! i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap. it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining.  however i think it depends on the person. because neither of those things actually bother me. i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy.  i think it's extremely comfortable and looks very cute on.  the zipper d,1,General,Dresses,Dresses

69,Love!,"I love how unique this top is, especially the buttons that run on the back.
it is cut boxy, but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on. the fabric is comfortable, and the stitching on the inside is not irritating.",1,General,Tops,Knits
63,Beautiful garment,"Well made garment. i love the colors, fabric and flounce at the bottom. the top is a little large on top with large armholes, but at least it will be cool on a hot summer day.",1,General Petite,Tops,Knits
61,Beautiful dress,Fits true to size. i am a size 4 and it fit perfectly. nice quality. fits like a glove.,1,General,Dresses,Dresses
57,Gorgeous!!,"I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!",1,General,Tops,Blouses
49,Great sweater,"The photos really doesn't do this sweater justice. when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos. this will be great over jeans or slim pants. i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big. at 5'5"" it drapes nicely and covers my rear end. the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms. others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the",1,General,Tops,Fine gauge
40,Comfortable and great for work,I love this skirt and was so happy to see it in stores again in a great color for the fall. the fit is great for me because i do not have a flat stomach and the elastic makes it comfortable to wear. the material is a good quality. this skirt adds the perfect pop of color to my closet.,1,General,Bottoms,Skirts
46,Comfortable and stylish,These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.,1,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
47,Love the fit...the color runs! run washer 2nd time,"I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though, so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants, but wanted to let you kno",1,General,Bottoms,Jeans
26,Love retailer bathing suits!,Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,1,Initmates,Intimate,Swim
58,A wardrobe essential,"You must have this vest for your fall/winter wardrobe. the design is extremely flattering to the female curves. i love the feminine ruffles. the pockets are a bonus. the vest is vegan-friendly. a hundred percent polyester! i normally wear a medium, but the small size fits me better. as an artist, i like to wear with my red plaid retailer shirt. hurry and get this vest before they are sold out. i'm sick i missed out on the museum district vest. all the smalls were sold out. i hope my experie",1,General,Jackets,Outerwear
53,Super comfy a tad long,"Love these pants! the are super comfy and very flattering, but they are very long. i did manage to have them altered,but you may risk losing the flare, which is unfortunate considering the price.",1,General,Bottoms,Jeans
86,Loved these!,"I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!",1,General,Tops,Knits
61,Cute and comfy,"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!",1,General,Dresses,Dresses
65,Perfect,"For me, this is the perfect tshirt. love the shape, size, material etc. just really like it. flattering and good quality.",1,General,Tops,Knits
60,Cute!,"Purchased this top in medium. i am 5'9"" so normally wear medium. however, could probably have ordered a small. sleeves are very long and it's very full around bottom. love the gold color!",1,General Petite,Tops,Knits
59,Runs large,"The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle, then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality, but not practical.",0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
36,Mixed feelings,"The print on this dress is gorgeous---but the material does not stretch whatsoever, and there are not zippers or buttons to ease in the fit. i always, always, always wear a size zero. it was a massive struggle to even get the dress over my head and on to my body. i felt like i was getting crushed! once on, although awfully small, the dress is just beautiful in every way. so chic! i just returned it and ordered two sizes up---here's hoping it fits!",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
29,Soft and elegant,"This sweater is very lightweight with the loose knit, but is much warmer than i was expecting. the periwinkle color is gorgeous. the chiffon hem provides a cute detail and it is true to size for a loose fit",1,General,Tops,Fine gauge
55,Similar but not quite as amazing as a similar one,"I don't like how short it is in the back.
i also prefer a solid vs. slubby material, 
back it goes.",1,General,Tops,Knits
31,Beautiful and high end!,"As soon as i tried on this cardigan i knew i had to have it. it takes your outfit to a glam and high end look. the fabric is oh so soft and i loved how it draped. the sleeves hang low and give you a vintage feel. i would give this a 5 star rating however, the downside to this cardigan is the shedding! it shed all over my black pants when i wore it, and on my friends too! :( i really went back and forth on returning this, but i think it's so beautiful i am keeping it. i am hoping over time the sh",1,General Petite,Tops,Sweaters
41,Beautiful winter color,"Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well",1,General,Tops,Blouses
39,Super cute and fitted,"I tried this one without a bra, and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.
the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides, so where the seem is on the legs by the wait, didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that, but hard for me not to look at.
also, the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite, but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that, the hem went to below the big part of my calf, so it 3was flatte",1,General,Bottoms,Pants
41,Hot pink,"I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.",1,General Petite,Tops,Knits
41,Stretch out,"These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day, they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer",0,General,Bottoms,Pants
51,,"Cute skirt! i bought it to go with boots (tall and short) and looks great. if you pair it with the right top, it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for! i usually wear a size 2 or 4 and i went with the 2 because it didn't hang so low. but that's just me.",1,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
54,Raspberry delight of a dress,"Tried on a size 2 regular and it fit well, felt incredibly soft and airy, and is handwashable. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 or 38, with narrow shoulders and torso, somewhat long-waisted but petite from bust to shoulders. i often wear a size 0p or 0 in retailer dresses and tops. the arm holes were a tiny bit low, but not terrible. a petite would have been shorter, but also more of an empire waist. the pink really is more of a red like the online photo; great color.",1,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
73,10++++++,"I can't rate this with enough stars or numbers! great fit, can't see up the sleeve, perfect length, just right amount of fabric for draping. i am 5'3"" and 130lbs. fits like a dream and when i got it home from the store....it goes with all things in the closet!!! my one reservation is it only comes in one color. let's get on it designers! we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white. i don't need any other top! this one has great cool fabric and you don't need to wear",1,General Petite,Tops,Knits
66,Foret cardigan,"Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems.",1,General,Tops,Sweaters
22,,,1,General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge
41,Armholes too large,"With a rather large chest, i am always having to size up in tops like this. the l fit well all over but the arm holes were just too low. even if i wore a navy bra (i got the navy version) it would still be cut too low. it's too bad because it is a beautiful and unique piece",0,General,Tops,Knits
57,The perfect denim midi skirt,"I followed everyone's advice in the reviews and ordered up one size. i have a 32 inch waist, but size 10's (and 30's in pilcro hyphens) usually fit me. i ordered the 12 in this skirt, and it fits perfect. it's form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out, but i'm curvy. if you are straighter, it will be looser around the hips. i love the length. it hits me mid calf, so a bit lower than it does on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. the fabric is soft, but has no stretch. it's 100% cotton. there is a",1,General,Bottoms,Skirts
64,"Cute, with reservations","First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!), plus 2"" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side, it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one, but know that it is also delicate. after one use, there is a snag on the inside",0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
65,,I love this sweater. the green is soft. the fabric is light enough for year round in my area. i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me. i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today.,1,General,Tops,Fine gauge
39,"Runs small only because of ""vanity"" saizing","I used to be a solid ""2"" then had to move down to 0 and 00... #i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs#, in this definitely a 2. the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing ""up"" #if you are between sizes, choose bigger, teh cutis so flattering, it wont matter#.
the colros are really pretty, the flow of the shirt is romantic, sleeves are forgivin can't go wrong. hte back is a little longer, and covers the tushy. i can see this with flared bottoms, or pencil skirt or skiny jeans, even",1,General,Tops,Blouses
52,Fantastically stunning but try before buying,"Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo",1,General,Dresses,Dresses
37,New fall staple,"I love this top. it's so soft and the cut is so flattering for a sweater! the sleeve holes are low enough so that you could easily layer underneath it but high enough to be work alone. the knit is a perfect fall thickeness...warm but not too thick. i am 5'11"" 130lbs and i got the medium for the extra length.",1,General,Tops,Sweaters
33,Love,"Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'5, 120lbs & ordered the sp & xs, i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist, there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.",1,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
