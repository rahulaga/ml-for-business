enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        },\n\"General\",\n\"Dresses\",\n\"Dresses\"],\n [{\n            'v': 15,\n            'f': \"15\",\n        },\n{\n            'v':

these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f':
