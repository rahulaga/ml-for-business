NER is used in a number of business applications such as powering recommender systems, simplifying customer support, and optimizing internal search engines. \n","\n","The notebook is broken down into the following three sections:\n","   * NER packages: An overview of the language, license, and methodology of commercially available NER packages\n","   * NER with SpaCy : Code examples for training and serving a custom NER model in SpaCy\n","   * NER with Tensorflow : Code examples for creating, training, and serving a custom deep-learning NER model with Tensorflow\n","\n","# 1. Named Entity Recognition Research & Examples\n","\n","\n","\n","## Named entity recognition packages\n","\n","NER can be implemented with either statistical or rule-based methods, both of which require a large amount of labeled training data and are typically trained in a fully or semi-supervised manner. Statistical approaches to NER include Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy, and Conditional Random Fields, as well as deep learning approaches with Recurrent Neural Networks, such as Seq2Seq. All of these processes involve sentence inputs and annotated sentence outputs. Many of these processes also involve additional feature engineering, providing as input summary statistics of the sentences.\n","\n","Many of the production-ready NER packages are written in Java and served as Docker containers, such as GATE, OpenNLP, and DBPedia spotlight. SpaCy is perhaps the most frequently used NER package in Python. \n","\n","\n","| Name | Language   | License | Method        |\n","|------|------------|--------|----------------|\n","| [GATE](https://github.com/GateNLP/gateplugin-Java) | Java       |   GPLv3     |  Hidden Markov |\n","|[OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org)| Java      |     Apache 2.0   | Maximum Entropy / Rule-based |\n","|[DBPedia](https://opennlp.apache.org)| Java      |    Apache 2.0    | Rule-based |\n","|[SpaCy](https://spacy.io)| Python/Cython      |    MIT  | Convolutional NN |\n","\n","## NER Methods\n","\n","NER may be implemented with a variety of statistical and rule-based methods with varying amounts of feature engineering. All production-ready NER methods are at least semi-supervised, though unsupervised approaches are an emerging research topic.\n","\n","#### Supervised statistical\n","\n","Supervised statistical approaches to NER typically use either Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Maximum Entropy (ME), or Conditional Random Fields (CRF). OpenNLP's statistical NER relies on ME. GATE relies on HMM.\n","\n","Typical feature engineering approaches for NER include such approaches as orthography, n-grams, lexicons, suffixes and prefixes, unsupervised cluster features, and trigger words for named entities (such as river or lake). These features are generated algorithmically in a rule-based manner.\n","\n","    \n","#### Supervised rule-based\n","\n","OpenNLP contains rule based (as well as statistical) NER. The rule-based approach relies on a series of regular expression matches. The feature generation seems to be done with a beam search to determine the word context.\n","\n","DBPedia spotlight performs NER with substring matching using the Aho-Corasick algorithm. The approach only uses tokenization with no other feature engineering. The two-step approach first involves generating all possible candidate annotations that form known labels. This is rule-based in that it involves identifying nouns, prepositions, capitalized words, and known entities. This is based on OpenNLP under the hood. The second step selects the best candidates from the proposed candidates. Each candidate is scored based on annotation probability using a version of tf-idf with article links and anchor texts instead of documents and terms.\n","\n","\n","#### Supervised deep learning\n","\n","**[SpaCy](https://spacy.io),** which is one of the most popular productionized NER environments, **uses residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) and incremental parsing with Bloom embeddings for NER.** See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqDHBH9IjRU) Youtube explanation from the developers for more detail. To summarize the algorithm, 1D convolutional filters are applied over the input text to predict how the upcoming words may change the current entity tags. Upcoming words may either shift (change the entity), reduce (make the entity more granular), or output the entity. The input sequence is embedded with bloom embeddings, which model the characters, prefix, suffix, and part of speech of each word. Residual blocks are used for the CNNs, andn the filter sizes are chosen with beam search.\n","\n","Recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches to NER also exist, typically comprising long short term memory networks (LSTM) at either the word- or character-level, relying on word or character embeddings, respectively (e.g. word2vec, gloVe, FASTtext).\n","    \n","## NER Datasets\n","\n","Although there are a number of datasets for NER in other languages, here we will focus on English datasets. Many of the NER datasets are domain-specific (i.e. Twitter, biomedical, advertising, news). A few standard NER datasets are described below to show the range of domain applications of NER.\n","   * [i2b2](https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/DataSets/) - Medication, treatments, diseases, risk factors, and medications\n","   * [CoNLL 2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) - English and german news articles annotated with location, organization, person, and miscellaneous\n","    \n","    \n","## NER Evaluation metrics\n","\n","NER is most commonly evaluated with precision, recall, and F1-score. F1-score can either be relaxed or strict, with the latter requiring the character offsets to match exactly. \n","    \n","# 2. Named entity recognition with SpaCy\n","\n","This section will focus on the Python package SpaCy for demonstrating named entity recognition. SpaCy is an open-source python library for NLP written in Python and Cython. It offers pre-trained models for multi-language NER, as well as allowing developers to train and deploy custom NER models on domain specific corpuses. SpaCy models are designed to be production-ready. \n","\n","SpaCy's pretrained models are trained on the [OntoNotes 5](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) corpus, and support the identification of the [following entities](https://spacy.io/models/en): \n","\n","\n","|TYPE\t| DESCRIPTION\n","------------ | ------------\n","|PERSON\t| People, including fictional\n","|NORP\t|Nationalities or religious or political groups\n","|FAC\t|Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc\n","|ORG\t|Companies, agencies, institutions, etc\n","|GPE\t|Countries, cities, states\n","|LOC\t|Non-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water\n","|PRODUCT|\tObjects, vehicles, foods, etc. (Not services.)\n","|EVENT\t|Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc\n","|WORK_OF_ART|\tTitles of books, songs, etc\n","|LAW\t|Named documents made into laws\n","|LANGUAGE|\tAny named language\n","|DATE\t|Absolute or relative dates or periods\n","|TIME\t|Times smaller than a day\n","|PERCENT|\tPercentage, including ”%“\n","|MONEY\t|Monetary values, including unit\n","|QUANTITY|\tMeasurements, as of weight or distance\n","|ORDINAL|\t“first”, “second”, etc\n","|CARDINAL|\tNumerals that do not fall under another type\n","\n","While these pretrained models are often sufficient for general applications, we will consider a domain-specific application of NER on the [MIT Movies corpus](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/downloads/movie/), which contains 10,000 queries about various aspects of movies, with the following entity labels:\n","\n","| Type | Example |\n","------- | ------- |\n","| ACTOR | Matt Damon |\n","| YEAR | 1980s |\n","| TITLE | Pulp Fiction\n","| GENRE | science fiction\n","| DIRECTOR | George Lucas |\n","| SONG | Aerosmith |\n","| PLOT | Flying cars |\n","| REVIEW | must see |\n","| CHARACTER | Queen Elizabeth |\n","|RATING | PG-13 |\n","|RATINGS_AVERAGE | best rated |\n","| TRAILER | preview\n","\n","As these tables show, the pretrained SpaCy models would not be sufficient to identify entities to help answer a question such as \"did george clooney make a science fiction movie in the 1980s?\" While the pre-trained entities may identify the presence of `PERSON`, `DATE`, and `PRODUCT`, a custom model should be able to detect `ACTOR`, `GENRE`, and `DATE`. In the following sections, we will compare the results of applying a pre-trained and a custom-trained model to the MIT movies corpus."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gHun2u4d_iJy"},"source":["### Install and import required packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NDw4rt3y_iJz","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620319185321,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":4798,"user":{"displayName":"Rahul Agarwal","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gic-nH14VawUcPdM00Ql5wRlLZriB8bxSUFtFeF=s64","userId":"12563796379587257440"}},"outputId":"438cd9d0-4570-471b-f8c1-af6312da34d3"},"source":["import sys\n","!{sys.executable} -m pip install spacy # !{sys.executable} ensures package installation in conda env"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: spacy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (2.2.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: preshed<3.1.0,>=3.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (3.0.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cymem<2.1.0,>=2.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (2.0.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (56.0.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: catalogue<1.1.0,>=0.0.7 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (1.0.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.15.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (1.19.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests<3.0.0,>=2.13.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (2.23.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: plac<1.2.0,>=0.9.6 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (1.1.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: thinc==7.4.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (7.4.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: srsly<1.1.0,>=1.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (1.0.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: blis<0.5.0,>=0.4.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (0.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: wasabi<1.1.0,>=0.4.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (0.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: murmurhash<1.1.0,>=0.28.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (1.0.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm<5.0.0,>=4.38.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from spacy) (4.41.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata>=0.20;
